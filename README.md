# TwoSinglet_H3H2H1
Set up the asymmetric decays of a heavy scalar in Herwig 7

The ```unweighted_events.lhe.gz``` file was generated via MadGraph 5 using the TwoSinglet model (https://gitlab.com/apapaefs/twosinglet). 

```iota0``` is the heaviest scalar (925 GeV in the LHE file), which can then decay to a ```eta0``` of a choosen mass and a Higgs boson (h0), via:

$\iota_0 \rightarrow \eta_0 h$
